# Spring2021-CS2124-Project1-MultilevelQueueScheduler
This project was the first project I was assigned by my Data Structures class during the Spring semester of 2021. The goal was to simulate a schedule using Queues.
I did work together with one other person on this, and their name is left in the comments of the main .c file, "driver.c".
